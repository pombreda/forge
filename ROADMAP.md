# To Do List

## Rubyforge REST API

Rewrite Rubyforge class to use REST API.

See:
* http://api.rubyforge.org/
* http://codeforpeople.rubyforge.org/svn/rubyforge/trunk/lib/rubyforge.rb

## Support for Sourceforge.org

If forge/laforge is to remain a viable project it will need to at least support
sourceforge.org b/c Rubyforge.org is being phased out. I have placed most of the
old MetaProject/Xforge code in the work directory for reference.

* Use Xforge code to build support for Sourceforge.org
* Possibly rename project from 'forge' to 'laforge'
* Transfer project to sourceforge.org laforge project
